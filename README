INSTALLING:

The program requires X11 with GL/GLX libraries.



USAGE:
------
In the directory containing the compiled program type:

./runme


Note that runme is a script that

RULES OF THE GAME:
------------------

In each round the player has to collect 10 objects randomly scattered
in a 3-dimensional scene.
The player can navigate by pressing
<Arrow keys>/<Home>/<End>/<Space> (with or without <Shift> key).

After each round he receives 1000000/((s+1)*(s+1)) points,
where s is the time in seconds of the round.
As soon as the player has collected 100 points or more in 
the stage a teleport gate appears in some place
that can be used to move the player to the next stage.

(Warning: Keyboard CapsLock must be off.) 


CONFIGURATION FILE OF THE GAME
------------------------------

Configuration file is a sequence of the file names.
Each of these files contains a shape designed
with E.T. EDITOR.
The first file contains the shape of the collected objects.
The second file contains the shape of the teleport gate.
The remaining files contain designs of the 3D scenes
used in the stages of the game.

You can extend the game by designing your own stages and adding
their names to the configuration file.
